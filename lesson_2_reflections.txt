What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	A hidden .git directory is created under the current directory. This indicates that the current durectory is to
	be version-controled using Git, and the directory will be used to store history and other meta data about this
	directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is a place the concentrates files that should be tracked for changes. It can contain only a part
	of the files on the working directory, and has no history yet, as opposed to files on the repository.
	Its value is allowing the user to decide which files he wishes to track and add to the repository in future commits.
